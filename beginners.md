## Stretching - for beginners

OK, if you believe you're a beginner and need to warm-up, here's a list of tasks to do **using ruby** before starting this book.

* **Strings**
  * Print the following string `\x52\x75\x62\x79\x46\x75` as it is, it should **NOT** be resolved to characters.
  * You have string `RubyFu` , convert this string to an array \(each character is an element\).
* **Arrays**
  * You have the following array `["R", "u", "b", "y", "F", "u"]` convert it to string `RubyFu`.
  * You have the following array `["1", "2", "3", "4"]`, calculate the sum of all elements.
* **Files and Folders**
  * Find all files ending with `.jpg` or `.pdf` or `.docx` or `.zip` in your Downloads folder.
  * Create a folder called `ruby-testfu` and copy all found files \(from the previous task\) into it.
* **Network**
  * Create a simple TCP server listening on port 3211. This server prints `date and time`.
  * Create a simple TCP client to connect to the previous server and print what the server sends.
