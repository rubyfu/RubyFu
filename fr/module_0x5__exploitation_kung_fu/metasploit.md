# Metasploit


## Code Design Pattern 
Metasploit uses **Facade** design pattern which encapsulates/simplifies the complex part of the framework by implementing it as interfaces which makes development really easy and elegant.
I found that the [Wikipedia][1] example of facades is descent to be presented 

```ruby
# Complex Parts | Computer framework 
class CPU 
  def freeze; end
  def jump(position); end
  def execute; end
end

class Memory
  def load(position, data); end
end

class HardDrive
  def read(lba, size); end
end

# Facade | Interface
class ComputerFacade

  def initialize
    @processor = CPU.new
    @ram = Memory.new
    @hd  = HardDrive.new
  end

  def start
    @processor.freeze
    @ram.load(BOOT_ADDRESS, @hd.read(BOOT_SECTOR, SECTOR_SIZE))
    @processor.jump(BOOT_ADDRESS)
    @processor.execute
  end
end

# Client (The Developer want to use the complex computer framework)
computer_facade = ComputerFacade.new
computer_facade.start
```

As you can see from the above code, the developer who wants to use the **Computer framework** don't have to deal with the complex codebase (classes, methods and calculations) directly. Instead, he will use a simple interface class called **`ComputerFacade`** which instantiate(as objects) all classes once you call it.

Another exist example in ruby language itself is `open-uri` standard library, which encapsulates `net/http` and `uri`  libraries and makes theme looks like opening ordinary file.
To see how `open-uri` makes things easy, We'll write a code that send get request to *Ruby.net* and get the response with both regular and `open-uri` way

**regular way**
```ruby
require 'net/http'
require 'uri'

url = URI.parse('http://rubyfu.net')

res = Net::HTTP.start(url.host, url.port) {|http|
  http.get('/content/index.html')
}

puts res.body
```

**facade way**

```ruby
require "open-uri"

puts open("http://rubyfu.net/content/index.html").read
```

## Metasploit Structure 

![](MSF-struct.png)

As you can see in figure above, Metasploit libraries are working as interface serves all modules, interfaces, tools and plugins. That's exactly represents what we've explained in **Code Design Pattern**.


```bash
 mkdir -p $HOME/.msf4/modules/{auxiliary,exploits,post}
```



## Absolute module 
Here is a very basic structure of a general module. 

I'll Add some comments for explanation purpose.


```ruby
##
# This module requires Metasploit: http://www.metasploit.com/download
# Current source: https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework
##

require 'msf/core'

### Module Type ###
class Metasploit3 < Msf::Exploit::Remote
####################

### Module Requirements ###
include Exploit::Remote::Tcp
####################

### Exploit Rank ####
  Rank = ExcellentRanking
####################

### Module Information
  def initialize(info = {})
    super(update_info(
      info,
      'Name'            => 'Absolute MSF template',
      'Description'     => %q{This is an absolute MSF template that shows how all modules look like},
      'License'         => MSF_LICENSE,
      'Author'          =>
        [
          'Rubyfu (@Rubyfu)',
          'Sabri (@KINGSABRI)'
        ],
      'References'      =>
        [
          ['URL', 'http://Rubyfu.net'],
          ['URL', 'https://github.com/Rubyfu']
        ],
      'Platform'        => %w{ linux win osx solaris unix bsd android aix},
      'Targets'         =>
        [
            ['Universal', {}]
        ],
      'DefaultTarget'  => 0,
      'DisclosureDate'  => '2015'
    ))

    # Module Options | show options
    register_options(
      [
          Opt::RPORT(22),
          OptString.new('USER', [ true, 'Valid username', 'admin' ]),
          OptString.new('PASS', [ true, 'Valid password for username', 'P@ssw0rd' ]),
      ], self.class)

    # Module Advanced Options | show advanced
    register_advanced_options(
      [
          OptInt.new('THREADS', [true, 'The number of concurrent threads', 5])
      ], self.class)
  end
####################


### Module Operations ###
  def exploit # or 'run' for post and auxiliary modules
    print_status('Starting Rubyfu')
    print_warning("It's just a template.")
    print_good('Ruby goes evil!')
    print_error("Thank you!")
  end
####################


end

```

The result is

### Load Metasploit module

To load/reload the Metasploit module you're working on, you can put the script in your user's Metasploit path or in the Metasploit framework path 

- User's Metasploit path
```
~/msf4/modules
```

- Metasploit framework path
```
metasploit-framework/modules/
```

To make Metasploit load/reload the script use one of the following ways

- Exit from msfconsole then run it again
- use `reload_all` to reload all modules
- If your module is previously loaded and you made changes on it just use `reload` but you have to be using the module, in another work `use [YOUR MODULE]`


**Note:** It's really important to know the official Metasploit development documentation **(** http://www.rubydoc.info/github/rapid7/metasploit-framework/ **)**
