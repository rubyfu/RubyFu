# Required Gems

I'd like to list all external gems that might be used in this book. This list will be updated once a new gem is required.

Note that you don't need to install them all unless you specifically need them.

## Main Gems

* Pry - An IRB alternative and runtime developer console.
* pry-doc - Pry Doc is a Pry REPL plugin. Extending documentation support for the REPL by improving the `show-doc & show-source commands.`
* pry-byebug - Combine 'pry' with 'byebug'. Adds 'step', 'next', 'finish', 'continue' and 'break' commands to control execution.

  ```text
  gem install pry
  gem install pry-doc
  gem install pry-byebug
  ```

  To run pry with best appearance

  ```bash
  pry --simple-prompt
  ```

> **Note:** Most of our examples will be executed on **pry** so please consider it as main part of our environment. Otherwise, when you see `#!/usr/bin/env ruby, it means a file script to execute.`

## Module Gems

Due the demand of wrapping all required gems into one gem, we've created [hacker-gems](https://rubygems.org/gems/hacker-gems) which installs all the below gems at one time.

```text
gem install hacker-gems
```

You might need to install some packages beforehand to avoid any errors of missing libraries.

```text
sudo apt-get install build-essential libreadline-dev libssl-dev libpq5 libpq-dev libreadline5 libsqlite3-dev libpcap-dev git-core autoconf postgresql pgadmin3 curl zlib1g-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev vncviewer libyaml-dev curl nmap
```
