# metasm
Metasm is a cross-architecture assembler, disassembler, linker, and debugger. More usage will be added for this awesome library.

- To install metasm 
```
gem install metasm
```

## Converting Assembly to Op-code - metasm-shell.rb
You can find metasm-shell in ruby gems default path after installation. In my case, it's located in `/var/lib/gems/2.1.0/gems/metasm-1.0.2/samples`

- Run it

```ruby
ruby metasm-shell.rb 
type "exit" or "quit" to quit
use ";" for newline

asm>
```
as you can see you are now in the shell's prompt

- Find assembly op-code 

```ruby
asm> nop nop
"\x90\x90"
asm> call [eax]
"\xff\x10"
asm> push esp
"\x54"
asm> pop eax
"\x58"
```
