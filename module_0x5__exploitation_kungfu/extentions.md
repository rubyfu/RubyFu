# Meterpreter Extensions

Meterpreter extensions are located in `metasploit-framework/lib/rex/post/meterpreter`

## Extension: `core`

path `metasploit-framework/lib/rex/post/meterpreter/client_core.rb`

```ruby
>> client.core
=> #<Rex::Post::Meterpreter::ClientCore:0x00000005f83388 @client=#<Session:meterpreter 192.168.0.18:55861 (192.168.242.128) "win7-64-victim\Workshop @ WIN7-64-VICTIM">, @name="core">
```

- **use**

This method used to load meterpreter extensions which is used in the meterpreter console (ex. `use sniffer`, `use mimikatz`, etc )
> Note: to list all loadable extensions in meterpreter console use `use -l` command.

From irb console of the meterpreter, let's try to use *sniffer* extension

```ruby
>> client.sniffer
=> nil
```
As you can see, it returns a `nil` because the method `use` is available in the `core` extension not in the meterpreter `client` instance.

Let's try to load the extension 
```ruby
>> client.use "sniffer"
=> nil
```

As you can see it returns a `nil` because the *sniffer* extension hasn't yet loaded in the ***core*** extension. 

- To load extension 

```ruby
>> client.core.use "sniffer"
=> true
```
