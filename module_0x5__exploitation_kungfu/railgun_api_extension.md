# Railgun API Extension
Quoting from Railgun presentation in DefCon20, **Railgun** is an extension to the Meterpreter STDAPI, allows arbitrary loading of DLLs. Since Windows API DLLs are always at known paths, we can always load them.

The ultimate benifits of using Railgun is getting the ability of dynamically access to the entire windows API on the system. By calling APIs from user process, we can impersonate user, anything become possible. 

Raingus is used as POST exploitation API so known it well would open a new abilities to the post exploitation phase.
