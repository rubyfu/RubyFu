# Fuzzer
Fuzzers usually used for generally or precisely applications functions. In this part we'll show how to fuzz most known services using ruby. Remember, Fuzzing is an **Art of Hitting Things**, it's not about tools.

## FTP Fuzzer
The general idea of fuzzing FTP service is to test all commands buffer size. However not the case isn't the same all the time for example, testing username and password buffers. In addition, the same technique could be applicable for many services even  customized services.

```ruby
#!/bin/ruby
# KING SABRI | @KINGSABRI
# Simple FTP COMMNDS Fuzzer
#
require 'socket'

class String
  def red; colorize(self, "\e[31m"); end
  def green; colorize(self, "\e[32m"); end
  def colorize(text, color_code);  "#{color_code}#{text}\e[0m" end
end

mark_Red   = "[+]".red
mark_Green = "[+]".green


host = ARGV[0] || "127.0.0.1"
port = ARGV[1] || 21

cmds = ["MKD","ACCL","TOP","CWD","STOR","STAT","LIST","RETR","NLST","LS","DELE","RSET","NOOP","UIDL","USER","APPE"]

buffer  = ["A"]
counter = 1

cmds.each do |cmd|
  buffer.each do |buf|

    while buffer.length <= 40
      buffer << "A" * counter
      counter += 100
    end

    s = TCPSocket.open(host, port)
    s.recv(1024)
    s.send("USER ftp\r\n", 0)
    s.recv(1024)
    s.send("PASS ftp\r\n", 0)
    s.recv(1024)
    puts mark_Red + " Sending " + "#{cmd} ".green + "Command with " + "#{buf.size} bytes ".green  + "Evil buffer" + ".".green
    s.send(cmd + " " + buf + "\r\n", 0)
    s.recv(1024)
    s.send("QUIT\r\n", 0)
    s.close
  end
  puts "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~".red
  sleep 0.5
end
```
