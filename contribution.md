1. Create a [Github][5] account.
2. Fork [RubyFu repository][4].
3. Clone github Forked RubyFu repository (`git clone https://github.com/[YOURGITBUBACCOUNT]/RubyFu`) 
4. Create a [Gitbook][6] account.
4. Go to [**Gitbook editor**][3] and Sign-in with your Gitbook account
5. Press **Import** button to import the cloned repository. Then, you'll find it in **LOCAL LIBRARY** tab
3. Add forked RubyFu repository Github URL to Gitbook Editor **Toolbar** >> **File** >> **Preferences** >> **GIT**.
4. Start your awesome contribution.
5. From Gitbook editor, **Sync** your changes to forked repository.
6. From Github, send a **Pull Request(PR)** to **Contributions** branch.


### Contributing with Code

##### Ruby code
* Use the triple ticks ` ``` `  followed by `ruby` then your code in between then ` ``` ` to get ruby code highlighted. eg.

        ```ruby
        puts "Ruby Code here"
        ```
* Explain the main idea -with some details- of the code, if you explain every line that would be great but it's not a must.
* Choose the correct Module.
* Make your title clear.
* Use Text editor/ide for code identification before pasting your code
* Mention the source, if you copied or developed a code that created by others please mention the souce in the footer. eg.

        ```ruby
        puts "Your good code"
        ```
        [Source][1]
    Then add the following to the footer

        [1]: http://TheSouceCodeURL

    Your notes should be under footer's line, Add the following to initiate the footer if not exist

        <br><br><br>
        ---
        YOUR NOTES SHALL BE HERE

* Try to use readable code, if you have to add more tricky/skilled code then explain it well
    > **Remember!** Hacker's code **=!** Cryptic code


##### Command-line
Use triple ticks to highlight your commandline. ex. 
    ```
    ls
    ``` 

> **Note:** Since this book is dynamically and un-ordered enhanced, it's hard to make the footer notes with order series of numbers for the whole book so -until I find better solution- I'll make the number order separated for each page separately.
