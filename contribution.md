### Contributing with Code

##### Ruby code
* Use the triple ticks ` ``` `  followed by `ruby` then your code in between then ` ``` ` to get ruby code highlighted. eg.

        ```ruby
        puts "Ruby Code here"
        ```
* Explain the main idea -with some details- of the code, if you explain every line that would be great but it's not a must.
* Choose the correct Module.
* Make your title clear.
* Use Text editor/ide for code identification before pasting your code
* Mention the source, if you copied or developed a code that created by others please mention the souce in the footer. eg.

        ```ruby
        puts "Your good code"
        ```
        Source [^1]
    Then add the following to the footer

        [^1]: Source: [The Original code Title](http://TheSouceCodeURL)

    Your notes should be under footer's line, Add the following to initiate the footer if not exist

        <br><br><br>
        ---
        YOUR NOTES SHALL BE HERE

* Try to use readable code, if you have to add more tricky/skilled code then explain it well
    > **Remember!** Hacker's code **=!** Cryptic code


##### Command-line
Use triple ticks to highlight your commandline. ex. 
    ```
    ls
    ``` 

> Note: Since this book is dynamically and un-ordered enhanced, it's hard to make the footer notes with order series of numbers for all the book so -until I find better solution- I'll make the number order separated for each page.
