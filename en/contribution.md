### Contributing with Code

##### Ruby code
* Use the triple ticks ` ``` `  followed by `ruby` then your code in between then ` ``` ` to get ruby code highlighted. e.g.

        ```ruby
        puts "Ruby Code here"
        ```
* Explain the main idea -with some details- of the code, if you explain every line that would be great but it's not a must.
* Choose the correct Module.
* Make your title clear.
* Use Text editor/ide for code identification before pasting your code
* Mention the source, if you copied or developed a code that created by others please mention the source in the footer. e.g.

        ```ruby
        puts "Your good code"
        ```
        [Source][1]
    Then add the following to the footer

        [1]: http://TheSouceCodeURL

    Your notes should be under the footer's line. Add the following to initiate the footer if it does not yet exist

        <br><br><br>
        ---
        YOUR NOTES SHALL BE HERE

* Try to use readable code, if you have to add more tricky/skilled code then explain it well
    > **Remember!** Hacker's code **=!** Cryptic code


##### Command-line
Use triple ticks to highlight your command-line. ex. 
    ```
    ls
    ``` 


### General Contribution
General contribution might be topic requests, proofreading, spilling, book organization and style. All these contributions are welcome however has to be discussed on [Rubyfu issues][7] especially things regarding to topics and/or book organization and styling. At the same time don't hesitate to report even single word observation about the book, it's for you at the end of the day.


> **Note:** Since this book is enhanced dynamically and unordered, it's hard to make the footer notes with order series of numbers for the whole book so -until I find better solution- I'll make the number order separated for each page separately.
