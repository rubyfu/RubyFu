# Required Gems
I'd like to list all external gems that might be used in this book. This list will be updated once new gem required. 

Note that you don't need to install it all unless you need it.

## Main Gems
- Pry
```
gem install pry
```
To run pry with best appearance
```bash
pry --simple-prompt
```

> **Note:** Most of our example will be executed on **pry** so please consider it as main part of our environment. Otherwise (when you see `#!/usr/bin/env ruby`) then it means a file script to execute.
