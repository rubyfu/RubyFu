This book is a collection of ideas, tricks and skills that could be useful for Hackers. It's a unique extraction reference, summarizes a lot of research and experience in order to achieve your **w00t** in shortest and smartest way. Rubyfu is where you'll find plug-n-hack code, Rubyfu is a book to use not to read, it's where ruby goes evil.


### Who should read this book?
Ideally, Hackers!; Those who have enough experience to hack our world and have *at least* basics in Ruby programming language. To get the best benefits of the book, open Rubyfu.net and pin its browser tab; Use irb/pry as interpreter to run the code or run it as script; Enhance the code to fit your needs and yeah, tweet the code and its output to [@Rubyfu][7] to share it with our awesome community.


### Organization of the book
#### Module 0x0 | [Introduction][0]
Module 0x0 is just a smooth start for you, whether you're a reader, writer, hacker or someone came to say hi. In this module you'll find a great start for you as a contributor, where all kinds of contributions are welcome starting from proofreading ending to topic writing.

#### Module 0x2 | [System Kung Fu][2]
Module 0x2 digs more in system hacking, where the system command, file manipulation, cryptography and generating the common hashes are needed.

#### Module 0x5 | [Exploitation Kung Fu][5]
Module 0x5 whatsoever the vulnerability was, remote (FTP, IMAP, SMTP, etc.) or local (file format, local system) you'll need to know how to build fuzzers and skeleton exploit for that. If you get there you'll need a simple, clean and stable way to build your exploit. Here you'll know how to build your fuzzer, exploit and porting your exploit to Metasploit and how to write your own Metasploit modules too.

#### Module 0x6 | [Forensic Kung Fu][6]
Module 0x6 whoever you're, good or bad guy you'll need forensic skills in your hack and/or investigation. Here you'll learn more how to deal with registry extracting browsers' information and much more.
