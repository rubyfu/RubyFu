```

In ruby script

```ruby

As you can see from response above, there are 5 sections

* ** Header section:** DNS lookup headers
* **Question section:** DNS question,
* **Answer section:** Array of the exact lookup answer (base on lookup type. ex. A, NS, MX , etc)
* **Authority section:** Array of authority nameserver
* **Additional section:** Array array of nameserver lookup

Since its all are objects, we can call each section like that
```ruby
resolver.header
resolver.question
resolver.answer
resolver.authority
resolver.additional
```

#### A record

Because the *A* record is the default, we can do like above example
```ruby
resolver = Net::DNS::Resolver.start("google.com")
```
or in one line to get exact **`answer`**.

```ruby
resolver = Net::DNS::Resolver.start("google.com").answer
```

will return an array with all IPs assigned to this domain
```
[google.com.             34      IN      A       74.125.239.35,
 google.com.             34      IN      A       74.125.239.39,
 google.com.             34      IN      A       74.125.239.33,
 google.com.             34      IN      A       74.125.239.34,
 google.com.             34      IN      A       74.125.239.36,
 google.com.             34      IN      A       74.125.239.32,
 google.com.             34      IN      A       74.125.239.46,
 google.com.             34      IN      A       74.125.239.40,
 google.com.             34      IN      A       74.125.239.38,
 google.com.             34      IN      A       74.125.239.37,
 google.com.             34      IN      A       74.125.239.41]
```

### MX lookup

```ruby
mx = Net::DNS::Resolver.start("google.com", Net::DNS::MX).answer
```
returns an array
```
[google.com.             212     IN      MX      40 alt3.aspmx.l.google.com.,
 google.com.             212     IN      MX      30 alt2.aspmx.l.google.com.,
 google.com.             212     IN      MX      20 alt1.aspmx.l.google.com.,
 google.com.             212     IN      MX      50 alt4.aspmx.l.google.com.,
 google.com.             212     IN      MX      10 aspmx.l.google.com.]
```

### All lookup

```ruby
any = Net::DNS::Resolver.start("facebook.com", Net::DNS::ANY).answer
```
returns
```
[facebook.com.           385     IN      A       173.252.120.6,
 facebook.com.           85364   IN      TXT     ,
 facebook.com.           149133  IN      NS      b.ns.facebook.com.,
 facebook.com.           149133  IN      NS      a.ns.facebook.com.]
```

for list of types, please refer to the [gem docs](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/net-dns/Net/DNS/RR/Types)


### Reverse DNS lookup

```ruby
resolver = Net::DNS::Resolver.new
query = resolver.query("69.171.239.12", Net::DNS::PTR)
```
If you want to specify the nameserver(s) to use, it support an array of nameserver
```ruby
resolver = Net::DNS::Resolver.new(:nameserver => "8.8.8.8")
```
or update the object
```ruby
resolver = Net::DNS::Resolver.new
resolver.nameservers = ["8.8.4.4" , "8.8.8.8"]
```
